TABLE (MATRIX) SECTION

The 2010 Census Summary File 1 is provided as a set, including 1 geographic header file and 47 data files.  The data files are presented in the table (matrix) section in segments.  They are ASCII format with variable length fields delimited by commas.  The data fields are numeric with the maximum size shown in MAX SIZE.  Each data file begins with a subset of fields from the geographic header file.  They are: file identification (FILEID), state/U.S. abbreviation (STUSAB), characteristics iteration (CHARITER), two-character file sequence number (CIFSN), and a logical record number (LOGRECNO).

NOTE: The alone or in combination categories are tallies of responses rather than respondents. That is, the alone or in combination categories are not mutually exclusive. Individuals who reported two races were counted in two separate and distinct alone or in combination race categories, while those who reported three races were counted in three categories, and so on. For example, a respondent who indicated “White and Black or African American” was counted in the White alone or in combination category as well as in the Black or African American alone or in combination category. Consequently, the sum of all alone or in combination categories equals the number of races reported (i.e., responses), which exceeds the total population.

NOTE 1: The numbers by American Indian and Alaska Native tribal grouping do not add to the total population. This is because the American Indian and Alaska Native tribal groupings are tallies of the number of American Indian and Alaska Native responses rather than the number of American Indian and 

Alaska Native respondents. Responses that include multiple American Indian and Alaska Native tribes are counted several times. For example, a respondent reporting "Apache and Blackfeet" would be included in the Apache as well as Blackfeet numbers.  "Not specified" includes respondents who checked the American Indian or Alaska Native response category on the census questionnaire and did not write in a specific group or wrote in a generic term such as "American Indian" or "Alaska Indian."

NOTE 1: The numbers by American Indian and Alaska Native tribal grouping do not add to the total population. This is because the American Indian and Alaska Native tribal groupings are tallies of the number of American Indian and Alaska Native responses rather than the number of American Indian and Alaska Native respondents. Responses that include more than one race and/or American Indian and Alaska Native tribal grouping are counted several times. For example, a respondent reporting "Apache, Blackfeet, and White" would be included in the Apache as well as Blackfeet numbers.  "Not specified" includes respondents who checked the American Indian or Alaska Native response category on the census questionnaire and did not write in a specific group or wrote in a generic term such as "American Indian" or "Alaska Indian."

NOTE:  "Families” consist of a householder and one or more other people related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption.  They do not include same-sex married couples even if the marriage was performed in a state issuing marriage certificates for same-sex couples.  Same-sex couples are included in the families category if there is at least one additional person related to the householder by birth or adoption. Responses of "same-sex spouse" were edited during processing to "unmarried partner."  Same-sex couple households with no relatives of the householder present are tabulated in nonfamily households.

		Black or African American alone or in combination
		  with one or more other races	H0080003	44	9

NOTE: The alone or in combination categories are tallies of responses rather than respondents. That is, the alone or in combination categories are not mutually exclusive. Individuals who reported two races were counted in two separate and distinct alone or in combination race categories, while those who reported three races were counted in three categories, and so on. For example, a respondent who indicated “White and Black or African American” was counted in the White alone or in combination category as well as in the Black or African American alone or in combination category. Consequently, the sum of all alone or in combination categories equals the number of races reported (i.e., responses), which exceeds the total number of householders.

NOTE:  A household that has at least one member of the household related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption is a “Family household.”  Same-sex couple households are included in the family households category if there is at least one additional person related to the householder by birth or adoption.  Same-sex couple households with no relatives of the householder present are tabulated in nonfamily households.  Responses of “same-sex spouse” were edited during processing to “unmarried partner.”  “Nonfamily households” consist of people living alone and households which do not have any members related to the householder.
